Emergency assignment from colleagues of gynecology.
On 05.06.12, this high-risk patient (ß-cholestasis and st.n. mamma-CA) underwent a complication-free lung maturation induction. On 08.06.12, however, headaches with transient ciliated scotomas that began temporally on the right and spread over the entire neurocranium appeared for the first time. Clinically, swelling of the eyelids on the right, as well as a slight epiphora and hyposensitivity in the area of the maxillary nerve on the right were also clinically impressive. The only native, and therefore only limited informative, cranial MRI examination revealed a signal alteration in the sigmoid sinus on the right. According to consultation with the neuroradiologists at the Inselspital, this corresponds most closely to an artifact or signal in the context of a slowed flow. In the case of symptoms of paracetamol that quickly regressed and responded well, our neurologist Dr. Fluri assessed them as part of tension headaches with a migraine component. According to the patient, there has been intermittent eyelid edema on the right and an effortful appearance of “white spots”. 
On 16.07.12, a frustrating initiation attempt was made. As a result, there was a recurrence of the right-stemporal/periorbital headache on 21.07.12 with subjective hypoesthesia in the area of the maxillary nerve, slight eyelid edema and ptosis, as well as marked miosis on the right. Complaints respond well to a single dose of Dafalgan 1g. 

8 days ago, the patient presented herself in an emergency practice at the Limmattal hospital for dysuria, pollakiuria. The symptoms were interpreted as urinary tract infections and treated orally since 27.07.2012 with ciprofloxacin 2 x 250mg daily, which the patient is currently taking regularly. The patient reports that, although dysuric pollakisuric symptoms have decreased from the first days after the start of antibiotic therapy, they feel constant suprapubic pain. This morning, she would have measured 39°C fever once, without chills. No fever in the last few days. Otherwise, the patient is free from complaints in good general condition. Since 27.07.2012, the patient has been taking ciprofloxacin 2 x 250mg of fixed medication. There is long-term treatment with Plavix 75mg once a day. It is also a preparation for stomach protection. 

Current suffering 
The patient had suddenly felt dizziness in the bathroom in the morning, after which she turned black in front of her eyes and the patient fell (not observed). She had hit the back of her head on the door and then fell unconscious. The patient was then found unconscious on the floor by the brother. 
Upon entry, the patient complains of headache (entire head), dizziness and pain everywhere, but especially in the stomach and in the area of surgery (sacral dermoid). 
The patient says that the pain in the area of the operating area is increasing and that there is also more and more bleeding from the wound. 
When asked more precisely, the patient reports that she had barely drunk in the last few days (<1l daily). 

An anamnesis with the patient is not possible. She only partially answers adequately, making suggestive gestures and facial expressions towards the staff. Locally, temporally and personally oriented.
Briefing by ambulance and police to the emergency ward in case of conspicuous social behavior and agitation. It was actually planned to refer the patient to Bellelay for inpatient treatment with FFE via her treating psychiatrist (Dr. Gerber). It is known from him that the patient has not taken her medication recently. 

During the course, there was an observed generalized seizure with discharge of urine, which stopped spontaneously. The CT of the skull showed no bleeding or bulk.

Stool and urine history inconspicuous (no unlucky stools, no blood abano). Gastroduodenal ulcer disease previously known. Afebril. Foreign/nutrition/environmental history inconspicuous. No B-symptoms.

The patient appears with another epistaxis with a tamponade lying down (inserted the previous day). Upon admission, hypertensive blood pressure values are shown, which normalize on administration of 2 isoctes. After this, the bleeding is also stopped. The patient says it never ran down his throat, only ever out of his nose. Until a few weeks ago, he had Coretan (?) Antihypertensive drug taken, but stopped currently. 

Presentation in the emergency ward with a headache that has existed since the previous day and has taken up the entire hemicrania on the right with a known migraine. The migraine symptomatology is always from the same writer, began at the age of 20 and occurs with different frequency. Last presentation in the emergency ward in June 2012: Various migraine therapies and prophylaxis have already been tried out, but all without effect. Only pethidine i.v. in a sufficiently high dosage would help him, and therapy with acupuncture would have led to temporary relief of the symptoms. 
Family history: father with similar migraine symptoms, persistent nicotine abuse

The patient wanted to go to sleep, but when lying down she felt severe spinning dizziness and then trembled all over her body, she then developed an uncontrolled feeling of anxiety, which the ambulance directed her to.

The symptoms were accompanied by a single diarrhoea during the dizziness attack and nausea (no vomiting). The patient denies increased stress.

Patient is very nervous, impatient and cannot find her Ritalin tablets again and needs a prescription. Pharmacy confirms that patient has a permanent prescription for Ritalin and is otherwise very reliable. Family doctor and supervising psychiatrist cannot be reached.

The patient was brought in by the ambulance. She has a known metastatic breast cancer, she is currently undergoing chemotherapy every 3 weeks, the last cycle was on 20.07.12. After that, the patient felt very tired. At around 04:00 in the morning, she woke up, felt dizzy, which caused a violent spinning sensation, especially when looking up or to the side. The patient could no longer lie down afterwards, as she immediately became very nauseous. She had a similar episode of dizziness on 19.11.2010, when similar spinning vertigo to the toilet had occurred during the night. Back then, tachycardial atrial fibrillation was apparent in the emergency unit, neurological failures or nystagmas could not be detected. After administration of Beloc Zok and normalization of the frequency and finally conversion to a sinus rhythm, the symptoms disappeared again. 
In addition to dizziness, the patient had noticed that she developed a strong urge to cough again. She was hospitalized in the medical ward on 31.03. - 08.04.2012 due to acute bronchitis with severe cough. After leaving hospital, things went better. The complaints had improved upon arrival at the emergency ward. However, the patient was still unable to look up or down and had to remain in a sitting position. 

Mr. Tesfagabir presented himself to us at the emergency gate with several medical problems. 

The patient introduced himself together with his brother, as he hardly speaks German himself. However, the medical history is difficult to collect. 
The patient was completely healthy 2 months ago. Now epigastric abdominal pain occurred 2 months ago, which is particularly noticeable when eating. Character of pains cannot be described by the brother. However, there was no nausea or vomiting and no diarrhoea (the patient was more prone to constipation). As a result of the abdominal pain, the patient has not eaten anything recently. This is reflected in a weight loss of 8 kg in the last 2 months. 

The patient also noticed that the urine smelled funny and that he had increased generalized itching. Especially in the morning, he had knee pain on both sides after getting up (an accident never occurred). 

PA: No previous conditions.

She would have vomited relapsingly and then went on emergency during the holidays (Albania) and would have received infusion and antibiotics (ceftriaxone) i.v. there. She would have continued this therapy until and including 27.7.2012. Since Monday, she would have continued to have severe sore throats and a slight cough with brownish sputum. On Thursday evening, she briefly presented herself at the emergency gate and did not want to be admitted, but only to have the antibiotics she had brought with her infused. If admission was needed from a doctor's point of view for a more precise assessment, the patient's father refused it and went home with Ms. Hoxha. Shortness of breath was denied. 

Anamnestically, the patient reports that she had already presented to Dr. Stampfli on Friday 27.7.2012 and the antibiotic therapy was switched from ceftriaxone to cefuroxime. In addition, a tonsillectomy is planned for 14.8.2012. 

Over the past 1-2 weeks, the patient's relatives have repeatedly reported short-term states of rigidity with pallor and slowed communication.

Not a fever.

Ms. Rüedi is assigned to us by the family doctor in case of suspicion of an MC fracture. She slipped and fell on her left hand 10 days ago. With persistent pain in her left thumb, she presented herself to the family doctor yesterday. Radiologically, a fracture could not be reliably ruled out due to its allocation to us. Right dominant.

The patient is brought to our emergency gate by the police, as Mr. Stucki would have attacked passers-by both verbally and physically (“shook”) at Biel train station. Mr. Stucki doesn't understand why he is brought to us by the police. He would have drunk alcohol, which is not forbidden. A focused anamnesis of today's events is not possible as the patient digresses on topics and events in the past (childhood rape, allegations of pedophilia against him). 
The ingestion of substances other than alcohol is denied by him. 
According to police, there is a hazard report from the city of Biel (from December 2012) with the instruction from Mr. Könizer (governor of Biel) that Mr. Stucki should be brought to the emergency gate in Biel as soon as he noticed a negative result.
According to him, Mr. Stucki does not have psychiatric treatment at present, because he had not received a follow-up appointment from the treating psychiatrist (which one is unclear). 

The patient was brought by the police, who had been alerted at about 11 PM through the Battenberg home, where she had sought shelter together with her baby. As Mrs. Bari was talking in confusion and the baby screamed, the police were notified. According to them, Mrs. Bari has been wandering around with the child in her arms since 4pm and wanted to stay with various people because it was difficult at home.
She describes as a basic problem that her eldest son (20-year-old) of a total of 5 children causes many problems and also deals with her husband (only the father of the two youngest children). Verbal riots had thus occurred, she felt that she was between two fronts and could no longer stand it.
Her son smokes a lot, steals and does not allow himself to be integrated into the family structure, which is why she has searched for him several times.
In addition, there are also relationship problems with the man, who had already threatened to be admitted to hospital.
Ms. Bari had previously been cared for by Dr. Wellinger of the Seeland Psychiatric Services and was most recently in contact with Dr. Rausch (psychiatrist) by telephone on 07.12.

The patient was brought to our emergency unit by her relatives (fiancé, mother, etc.) due to epigatry/thoracic pressure and anxiety.
On admission, circulatory stable, crying, sometimes stuporous, and initially inaccessible in conversation, patient in a pronounced depressed mood, without thoracic or epigstric pain.
After administration of 1 mg of Temesta s.l. slight improvement in communication with, however, significantly more difficult collection of anamnesis due to continuing stupor; poor compilation and motivation for conversation.
In the end, the patient stated under 4 eyes (in a confidential medical conversation without the presence of relatives) that she had taken 4x “sleeping pills” with suicidal intent (2 of them valerian, 2 more unclear). She would have bought the tablets on her own in a pharmacy about 1 week ago.
She has been feeling particularly bad for a week now, with “real” suicidal thoughts due to her unhappy relationship with her fiancée. The engagement took place in July 2012 with the consent of all parties. In the meantime, the fiancé has been in Kosovo and has recently returned, 1 week ago. 
There is a good relationship between the patient, her fiancé, the sister and the mutual family. The patient feels very unhappy because she doesn't love her fiancé. She sought a conversation with her sister, who had little understanding for her problem. Her fiancé is a good person and treats her well, yet she doesn't love him but doesn't want to hurt him and therefore doesn't want to leave him. There is no pressure from the family for an engagement or wedding. Separation would definitely not be an option for her, as she does not want to injure her fiancé or other members of the two families - while accepting her own suffering. She stands alone, with no understanding for her dilemma.

The patient is announced by her daughter-in-law by telephone with pain over the whole body for about 4 years, worsening of the general condition and a generalized reduction in strength. Today, exacerbation of the problem. Since the pain is localized epigastrically, among other things, it is assessed on the surgical emergency. Since Ms. Neziri hardly speaks German, communication takes place via her relatives. Unclear complaints have been reported for 4 years, ranging from epigastric pain with spread throughout the abdomen to dyspnoea, sweats and double vision. The patient has already been examined in numerous specialist clinics. About 2 weeks ago, during the neuromuscular consultation hours of the Inselspital, the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was made and cortisone therapy was started. We have a detailed report before us. Since the start of Spiricort medication, the patient has felt even worse than before, has gained weight and the family is very unsettled and overwhelmed by the overall situation and the new diagnosis. 
We do not receive a clear answer to multiple inquiries as to where the current pain problem is located. The main symptoms are pain in the upper abdomen on both sides on inspiration and as a hot flash. The patient, who comes from Macedonia, underwent an ultrasound scan of the upper abdomen while on vacation in the summer of this year, where, among other things, multiple concrements of the gallbladder were detected.

Last night she had a discussion with her husband, sister-in-law and her husband regarding her future. At 2 o'clock in the morning, the patient was tired and said goodbye to the round. The husband followed her into the bedroom and punched her in the left temple so that she was briefly unconscious. She then went back into the living room because she thought he wouldn't beat her in front of the others and lay down on the sofa. He suddenly came and slapped her face again.

Assignment by family doctor in case of suspicion of prosthetic infection knee left. The patient received a knee prosthesis on the left three years ago, which must be removed again in the postoperative course if infected with staphylococci. Extensive antibiotic therapy was carried out. A new knee prosthesis could then be inserted in January 2010. Since then, the patient has been symptom-free and no pathological findings were found at the last orthopedics check in January 2011.

The patient was therefore referred to us as an emergency in case of suspicion of prosthetic infection. When asked, the patient does not report any new pain, denies fever, swelling, redness, or overheating, and is generally in good health.

However, he had never been really symptom-free and occasionally he also felt a feeling of pressure in the middle lower abdomen. He hasn't vomited since Sunday, but he still feels nausea and loss of appetite, which is why he was only able to drink a little liquid. He has already taken 4 buscopan and 1 irfen today, most recently around 15:00. He didn't have a fever. He has had blood in his urine since he was 20 years old.

He also describes a serious accident at work in 1994 in which he sustained multiple bone fractures of the right lower limb, pelvis and right shoulder. Sudeck's disease progressed in the right foot, as well as aseptic bone. 
allergy to mephanol (- rash!) nicotine: 1 pck/d

As you are well aware, the patient was assigned to us for inpatient admission by your practice partner Dr. Aeschbacher. The focus was on a psychosocial problem, which led to a collapse at work on the day of the interview. In a lengthy conversation, the patient once again described her current difficult situation following the separation of her husband and the now greater burden of the two children being a single parent (as the husband avoids all responsibility) and her workload of 80%. On the day of the presentation, as in the last few days, there were renewed epigastric complaints, which subsequently led to complete decompensation of the patient. She currently no longer described an actual physical collapse with going to the ground. When asked how things should proceed now, she, contrary to expectations, is in favour of returning home. She wanted to take care of her children, whom the husband could not look after all overnight. In addition, she would be in touch with her treating psychiatrist Mrs. Brassi from the Biel-Seeland psychiatric services the following day to discuss the current problem. 

The patient was repeatedly offered that it would be no problem at all to hospitalize her overnight, but she declined gratefully. After giving us our emergency number, she was released home. 

Regarding epigastric complaints, we recommended that she take the proton pump blocker therapy you gave her for at least 2 weeks, as the symptoms are most likely to be gastritis (with repeated NSR intake) or gastroesophageal reflux. 

There are some uncertainties regarding the current medication. According to the list they kindly sent to us by fax, ciproxin and norfloxacin are taken concomitantly, as well as ecofenac and mefenamic acid. We assume that this is an incorrect medication list, otherwise urgent adjustments would be recommended. 

Current suffering 
Self-assignment to emergencies. The patient complains of progressive burning pain in the right upper abdomen for 3 days. These exacerbate with deep inspiration, coughing and sneezing. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation. The pain is constant regardless of food intake. Inconspicuous stool history and micturition, no blood in the stool. No fever, appetite normal. Mr. Isildak reports that he was diagnosed with cholelithiasis 2-3 years ago. If the symptoms were spontaneous, no surgery was performed at that time. He had planned to present himself to the family doctor tomorrow, but then came up with an emergency when the pain at home became unbearable.

They would have left the bar at 12:30, suddenly Mrs. Rolli was presyncoped and her upper extremities were extremely tense and was no longer really accessible. She could only walk with help.

She regularly takes Tranxilium 20 mg.  

Ms. Schwab had suffered from painless gross hematuria without trauma since the previous day. There was no pollakiuria and no alguria.

Patients are known to have HIV disease, regular six-month check-ups in the home infectiology department. The last check was carried out about 2 weeks ago. There has been no feedback on the results so far, so that he assumes a good result for the CD4 cell count. Professionally, he is head of 2 asylum seekers' homes and is exposed to permanent stress. In connection with this stress, he reported on chronically episodic, occasional, self-limiting diarrhoea, without an admixture of blood. Therapy with Atripla is available once a day.

Otherwise, the patient is healthy, no regular medication, no allergies

Mr. Hirschi presented himself on both sides, but emphasized on the left, because of recurrent stabbing chest pain that had existed for 2 days. As part of the pain, the patient also describes shortness of breath. This pain, which increases in frequency over the course of time, would last a maximum of 5 minutes and lying down would help. He also reported mild pain parasternally every 15 breaths. Otherwise, a slight pressure on the chest. Overall, the patient reported that partial movement would help or, conversely, increase pain. The patient denies taking any painkillers.
